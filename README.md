## What Can People Use It For?
The proposed decentralized commerce for digital assets using ERC1155 tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
- Facilitating cross-border transactions without the need for expensive intermediaries or delays due to currency conversion.
- Buying and selling digital art, music, and other educational assets in a secure, decentralized environment.
- Allowing artists/creators to list their digital assets for sale with their desired prices and limited supply, without the need for a middleman.
- Providing buyers with the ability to purchase unique and authentic digital assets that are recorded on a secure and transparent blockchain.

## How It Makes Existing Tasks Easier and Safer

The proposed marketplace using ERC1155 tokens makes several existing tasks easier and safer, including:
- Simplified token creation: Reduced redundant bytecode on chain!
- Reduced transaction fees: ERC1155 tokens are more efficient than other token standards like ERC20 or ERC721, allowing for reduced gas fees and network congestion. 
- Enhanced security: ERC1155 tokens support advanced security features such as metadata verification and digital signatures, which can help ensure the authenticity of digital assets. 
- Decentralized and transparent transactions: The use of a decentralized marketplace based on blockchain technology ensures that transactions are transparent and secure. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a transparent record of all transactions, making it easier for creators and buyers to transact with confidence.
Overall, the proposed marketplace using ERC1155 tokens provides a secure, efficient, and transparent way for artists/creators and buyers to transact in the digital asset market.

## Challenges
- An undefined object error was a sneaky little bug that caused our team a lot of headaches! 
- And also, one of the most challenging issues we faced was related to fetching asset details into personal inventory. We found that sometimes the asset details were not being properly rendered!
- Another hurdle we faced was related to the buy function. We found that sometimes the buy function was returning a transaction error, which prevented users from making purchases.
- Debugging the functions individually using log statements and observing the props and parameters carefully definitely helped a lot!
